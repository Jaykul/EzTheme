# Theme Them All

Collect theme information for various different themeable parts of your PowerShell environment into a single shareable theme file, and apply them all at once to switch the look of your shell.

From your normal "dark mode" to a light high contrast readable presentation theme! You can control everything from colors to fonts, whatever is supported by theme commands.

# Included Theme Modules

ThemeThemAll ships with wrapper modules for some common PowerShell features and modules which serve both to make it immediately useful, and as an example of how you can add theme support for other modules:

- PowerLine Prompt Colors
- PSReadLine Syntax Highlighting
- PowerShell Colors (Error, Debug, Warning, Verbose, Progress)
- Windows Console (16 + 2 colors + Font, Popup Colors)
- Windows Terminal (16 + 2 colors + Font)
